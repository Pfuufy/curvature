# Curvature.js
Curvature.js, or colloquially known in the developer community as just "Curvature", is a component-based, server-side code preprocessor. The name "Curvature" pays homage to Angular, the peanut to my butter.

## Why Curvature?
I wrote Curvature for one simple reason: by and large, we've lost the art of making frontend applications fast. We've chosen to prefer developer comfort over code quality and minimizing code bloat. Do you really need Angular to write a blog website? Loading the whole framework just to render some components and do a little bit of logic? I don't think so.
